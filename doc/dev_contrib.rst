Contributing code
#################

Here are the steps:

1. Write your code. Awesome!
2. If you haven't already done so, please consider writing tests. Otherwise, someone else will have to do it for you.
3. Same goes for documentation.
4. Review and sign the :abbr:`CAA (Copyright Assignment Agreement)` by adding your name and email to the :file:`AUTHORS` file. (This step can be skipped if your contribution is too small to be considered intellectual property, e.g. spelling fixes)
5. Open a pull request on `GitHub <https://github.com/trehn/blockwart>`_.
6. Feel great. Thank you.
