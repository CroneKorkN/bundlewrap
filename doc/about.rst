.. toctree::

Development on BundleWrap started in July 2012, borrowing some ideas from `Bcfg2 <http://bcfg2.org/>`_. Some key features that are meant to set BundleWrap apart from other config management systems are:

* decentralized architecture
* pythonic and easily extendable
* easy to get started with
* true item-level parallelism (in addition to working on multiple nodes simultaneously, BundleWrap will continue to fix config files while installing a package on the same node)
* very customizable item dependencies
* collaboration features like node locking (to prevent simultaneous applies to the same node) and hooks for chat notifications
* built-in testing facility (:command:`bw test`)
* can be used as a library

BundleWrap is a "pure" free software project licensed under the terms of the `GPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_, with no *Enterprise Edition* or commercial support.
