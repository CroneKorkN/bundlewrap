Is Blockwart the right tool for you?
------------------------------------

We think you will enjoy Blockwart a lot if you:

* know some Python
* like to write your configuration from scratch and control every bit of it
* have lots of unique nodes
* are trying to get a lot of existing systems under management
* are NOT trying to handle a massive amount of nodes (let's say more than 300)
* like to start small
* don't want yet more stuff to run on your nodes (or mess with appliances as little as possible)
* prefer a simple tool to a fancy one
* want as much as possible in git/hg/bzr
* have strongly segmented internal networks

You might be better served with a different config management system if you:

* hate Python and/or JSON
* like to use community-maintained configuration templates
* need unattended bootstrapping of nodes
* don't want to use SSH with key-based authentication and passwordless sudo to manage your nodes
* need to manage non-Linux systems
